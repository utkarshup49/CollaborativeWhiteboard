# Collaborative Whiteboard Powered by Blockchain

## Description
This project is a decentralized collaborative whiteboard application built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows multiple users to update and contribute to a shared whiteboard securely and transparently. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures data integrity, version control, and accountability in a decentralized environment.

## Vision of the Project
Our vision is to revolutionize online collaboration by creating a secure, tamper-proof, and user-driven whiteboard where ideas can be shared, refined, and visualized in real-time without relying on centralized servers.

## Future Scope
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Introduce permissions to restrict unauthorized changes.
- **Version History Tracking:** Implement a system to track and retrieve previous versions of the whiteboard content.
- **Real-Time Collaboration Tools:** Develop features like chat integration, drawing tools, and interactive elements.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Enhance usability across web, mobile, and desktop environments.
